# Palace Cop Bot
It does pretty much everything the name describes and not much more. I based this loosely off another cop bot (Supreme). It uses puppeteer for page automation however. I also included a method of bypassing captchas which can be nice for Palace cops.

1. Change your details in the user.js

2. Change your item in the items.js (can add multiple items)

3. Open in a terminal in the current directory and run the following commands 
```
npm install
```

```
node 
```
